## Objective

The objective of this software is to learn more about both the Unity3D Engine and Newton's Law of Physics by creating a virtual experiment using Newton's Formula.

## Topics Covered

The Unity topics covered include:
- Built in 3D shapes
- The RigidBody component
- Creating custom components using C# and attaching them to your GameObjects
- The Vector3dObject
- Making GameObjects accelerate by applying a force vector
- Setting the initial velocity of a GameObject
- Integrating custom component's configuration with the Unity3D Editor
